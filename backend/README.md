# Slashauth Demo Backend

This is a public repository showcasing how to spin up a backend integrated with Slashauth.

## Getting started

Grab your app's client secret from your [App Dashboard](https://app.slashauth.xyz) and toss it in `.env` (make a copy of `.env.example` and fill in the field).

Then, simply install the packages and start the app

```
npm install
npm start
```

Your app will run on port :8080. You can check out our [demo frontend app](https://www.github.com/slashauth/demo-react).
